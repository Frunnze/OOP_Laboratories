# Lab_0
1. I had installed macOS, so I skipped task nr. 1.
2. macOS has installed zsh and Git. So, I just took screenshots of their
   versions.
3. Then, I installed oh-my-zsh in the terminal with the command line: 
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
4. After, I installed Homebrew, with the following command line:
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
5. With Homebrew I installed gcc-12, with the command line:
   brew install gcc
6. For my IDE, I chose Visual Studio, which I had already installed before.
7. Then, I wrote a hello-world program and compiled it with GCC and Make.
   The screenshots of this are in the repository.
8. Next, I created this repository on github.com.
9. Initialized the git repository, with "git init".
10. Used "git add ." to prepare the files for commit.
11. Used "git commit -m "message"" to commit the changes.
12. Used "git remote add origin https://github.com/Frunnze/Lab_0" to add a new remote.
13. Finally, I used "git push -u origin master" to upload the screenshots and
    the program.
